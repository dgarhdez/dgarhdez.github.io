# Python for Data Analytics: Basics

Python is programming language with which we can do many things. It's a very versatile that will allow us to tackle many problems in different disciplines. In this course we will focus on the data analytics part of Python, which is a very popular use case for this language.

In the course we will cover several topics, always in the context of data analytics and data science.

## Pre-requisites

I will assume that you have a High School level of math, but for every concept that we introduce, I will explain it so that you can follow the course.

Other than that, common sense and a strong will to fail and learn from your mistakes are the only pre-requisites.

## Material needed

To follow this course you will need a computer with Python installed. Although it's very easy to choose an IDE and install Python, I recommend using Anaconda, which is a distribution that comes with Python and many other libraries that are very useful for data analytics.

You can download Anaconda from [this link](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).

Follow the instructions in the link to install Anaconda in your computer.

Whenever a new module is needed, I will let you know how to install it.

## Jupyter notebooks

Although we can run python code with a simple text file and the command line, we will use Jupyter Notebooks. This will allow us to mix code and text for the explanations, as well as to display charts and other visualizations.

You will have access to Jupyter Notebooks within Anaconda, but I strongly recomment to use Jupyter Lab, which is a more modern version of Jupyter Notebooks. More info on how to use Jupyter Lab can be found [here](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/interface.html).
