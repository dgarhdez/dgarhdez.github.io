# Python for Data Analytics: Loops

:arrow_left: [Loops](../07_loops/07_loops.md) - [Functions](../07_functions/07_functions.md) :arrow_right:

So far we've seen that we can control the flow of code by using [conditional expressions](../06_conditionals/06_conditionals.md) like `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

Another way to control the flow of code is by using loops. Loops allow us to execute a block of code multiple times, without having to write the same code over and over again.

There are two main types of loops in Python:

* `for` loops: used to iterate over a sequence (e.g. a list, tuple, or string)
* `while` loops: used to execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is met

We can mix loops with conditionals to create more complex programs.

Before diving into loops, let's see some ways to create iterable objects in Python.

## Iterables

An iterable is an object that can be used in a loop. In Python, there are several types of objects that are iterable.

Some of the iterables are the [data structures](../05_data_structures/05_data_structures.md) that we already know: lists, tuples, strings, sets, dictionaries.

But there are others that are new to us:

* `range` objects
* `enumerate` objects
* `zip` objects
* `items` method of dictionaries

### `range` objects

`range` objects are used to generate a sequence of numbers. They are very useful when we want to iterate over a sequence of numbers.

They use the same syntax we know for slicing lists: `range(start, stop, step)`.

```python
my_range = range(0, 10)

print(my_range)
```

> Output: `range(0, 10)`

When printing a `range` object, we see that it is a range from 0 to 10, but it is not a list. This is because `range` objects are not lists, they contain the "recipe" to generate a sequence of numbers without generating it in memory.

So, if want to see the numbers in the range, we need to convert it to a list:

```python
my_range = range(0, 10)

print(list(my_range))
```

> Output: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`

### `enumerate` objects

`enumerate` objects are used to create a new iterable that contains pairs of values: the index of an element and the element itself.

They are very useful when we want to iterate over a sequence and we need to know the index of each element.

```python
my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']

print(list(enumerate(my_list)))
```

> Output: `[(0, 'a'), (1, 'b'), (2, 'c')]`

Just like `range` objects, `enumerate` objects are not lists. They contain the "recipe" to generate the pairs of values without generating them in memory.

### `zip` objects

`zip` objects are used to create a new iterable that pairs elements from two or more sequences.

They are very useful when we want to iterate over two or more sequences at the same time.

```python
my_list1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
my_list2 = [1, 2, 3]

print(list(zip(my_list1, my_list2)))
```

> Output: `[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]`

Just like `range` and `enumerate` objects, `zip` objects are not lists. They contain the "recipe" to generate the pairs of values without generating them in memory.

### `items` method of dictionaries

The `items` method of dictionaries is used to create a new iterable that pairs keys and values from a dictionary. It's like using `zip` with the keys and values of a dictionary.

```python
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}

print(list(my_dict.items()))
```

> Output: `[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]`

## `for` loops

When we know how many times we need to repeat a block of code, we can use a `for` loop.

It can be used because we know the amount of iterations, or because we have an iterable object that we want to iterate over.

The syntax of a `for` loop is:

```python
for item in iterable:
    # code block to be executed
    # as many times as there are
    # items in the iterable
```

The iterable can be a predefined list, tuple, string, set, dictionary, or any other iterable object like `range`, `enumerate`, or `zip`.

Let's see some examples:

* Print the numbers from 0 to 3 using a `range` object:

```python
for number in range(4):
    print(number)
```

> Output: 0

> Output: 1

> Output: 2

> Output: 3

As you can see, the same syntax requirements we had for `if` statements, apply for `for` loops:

* Start with `for xxx in iterable` and then a colon `:``
* Indent the block of code representing the task(s) to be repeated for each element in the iterable

Let's see the effect of indentation in a `for` loop: printing each character in a string but converted to upper case.

```python
#Â correct 
my_string = 'hello'

for character in my_string:
    upper_char = character.upper()
    print(upper_char)
```

> Output: H

> Output: E

> Output: L

> Output: L

> Output: O

But if we dont indent the `print` statement, the result changes dramatically:

```python
# incorrect
my_string = 'hello'

for character in my_string:
    upper_char = character.upper()
print(upper_char)
```

> Output: O

What happened is that since the `print` statement is not indented, then Python is not considering that it's a task that should be repeated for every character.

What Python is doing here is letting the loop run for each character, finishes it, and then out of the loop it prints whatever is in `upper_char`, which is the last character in upper case.

So, indentation is crucial.
