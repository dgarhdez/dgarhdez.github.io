#  About me

Hi there :wave:

I'm Daniel García Hernández, and I work with Data.

I've been working with data for the last 8 years, mostly in the energy sector and lately in the e-commerce sector.

I'm mostly experienced in Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and Analytics Engineering. I'm the most comfortable with Python and SQL.

I also teach Python for Data Analytics at [IE School of Science and Technology](https://www.ie.edu/school-science-technology/faculty/daniel-garcia-hernandez/).
