#  About me

Hi there! I'm Daniel García Hernández, and I work with Data. I've been working with data for the last 8 years, mostly in the energy sector and lately in the e-commerce sector.

I'm mostly experienced in Analytics Engineering, Data Analytics and Machine Learning. I've worked with many tools and languages, but Python is the one I've used the most, along with SQL.

I also teach Python for Data Analytics at [IE School of Science and Technology](https://www.ie.edu/school-science-technology/faculty/daniel-garcia-hernandez/), you can see the course [here](/pda/pda_index.md).
